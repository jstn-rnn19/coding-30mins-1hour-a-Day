## Days 1–30: Python Basics
| Day | Task Description |
|-----|------------------|
| 1   | Install Python and set up your environment. Run your first script: `print("Hello, World!")` |
| 2   | Learn variables and data types: int, float, string, boolean. Print variable types. |
| 3   | Practice arithmetic operations: +, -, *, /, %, //, **. Build a simple calculator. |
| 4   | Get user input with `input()`. Create a script to greet the user by name. |
| 5   | Understand string indexing, slicing, concatenation. Reverse a string. |
| 6   | Use string methods like `.upper()`, `.lower()`, `.strip()`, `.replace()`. Normalize input. |
| 7   | Learn conditional statements: `if`, `else`, `elif`. Check if a number is positive, negative, or zero. |
| 8   | Use logical operators: `and`, `or`, `not`. Check if a number lies within a range. |
| 9   | Practice nested and multiple conditions. Create a grading system (A, B, C...). |
| 10  | Learn `while` loops. Print numbers 1 to 10 using `while`. |
| 11  | Learn `for` loops. Iterate over a list and print items. |
| 12  | Use `range()` in loops. Print even numbers from 2 to 20. |
| 13  | Practice `break` and `continue` in loops. Skip multiples of 3 while printing 1 to 20. |
| 14  | Work with lists: creation, indexing, appending. Manage a shopping list. |
| 15  | Use list slicing and methods. Reverse a list and find max/min. |
| 16  | Understand tuples (immutable lists). Store and print coordinate tuples. |
| 17  | Use sets to remove duplicates from a list. |
| 18  | Work with dictionaries: create a contact book. Add, update, retrieve contacts. |
| 19  | Loop through dictionaries. Print all contact names and numbers. |
| 20  | Define and call functions. Write a factorial function. |
| 21  | Use function parameters and return values. Check if a string is a palindrome. |
| 22  | Use default and keyword arguments. Enhance palindrome check to ignore case and spaces. |
| 23  | Understand variable scope: local vs global. Practice examples. |
| 24  | Use lambda functions. Sort a list of tuples by the second value. |
| 25  | Read and write files. Count word frequency in a text file. |
| 26  | Handle exceptions with try/except. Manage file-not-found errors. |
| 27  | Create and import your own modules with utility functions. |
| 28  | Use standard libraries like `os`, `sys`, and `math`. List files in a directory. |
| 29  | Learn classes and objects. Create a simple `Person` class. |
| 30  | Instantiate classes and use methods. Create multiple `Person` objects. |

## Days 31–60: Control Flow, File Handling, Intermediate OOP

| Day | Task Description |
|-----|------------------|
| 31  | Deep dive into complex `if` statements and nested conditions. |
| 32  | Practice logical operators with nested conditions. Build access control script. |
| 33  | Use advanced for-loop patterns: `enumerate`, `zip`, `else`. Pair two lists. |
| 34  | Practice while loops with exit conditions. Create a guessing game with limited tries. |
| 35  | Read files line-by-line and manage file pointers. Parse a CSV file selectively. |
| 36  | Write files with append and write modes. Create a log writer with timestamps. |
| 37  | Use file context managers (`with`) for safe file handling. |
| 38  | Catch multiple exceptions. Create a robust file reader with error logging. |
| 39  | Use functions with variable arguments (`*args`, `**kwargs`). Flexible calculator function. |
| 40  | Learn recursion basics. Implement Fibonacci and factorial recursively. |
| 41  | Understand class inheritance. Create base class `Vehicle` and subclass `Car`. |
| 42  | Override methods and use `super()`. Extend your classes. |
| 43  | Differentiate class and instance attributes. Track total instances. |
| 44  | Use properties with getters/setters for attribute validation. |
| 45  | Implement static and class methods in your classes. |
| 46  | Use magic methods (`__init__`, `__str__`, `__repr__`) in classes. |
| 47  | Overload operators like `+`, `==` in your classes. |
| 48  | Organize code into modules and packages. Practice importing. |
| 49  | Install and use external libraries with `pip` (e.g., `requests`). Fetch web data. |
| 50  | Debug Python scripts with `pdb`. Step through code and inspect variables. |
| 51  | Replace print statements with Python’s logging module. |
| 52  | Work with JSON: serialize and deserialize data. |
| 53  | Learn regular expressions. Validate email and phone number formats. |
| 54  | Use regex for extraction and replacement. Anonymize sensitive text data. |
| 55  | Handle CSV files with the `csv` module. Read/write with different delimiters. |
| 56  | Use command-line arguments with `sys.argv`. Accept filenames and options. |
| 57  | Package your code for reuse. Create `setup.py` and install locally. |
| 58  | Write unit tests using `unittest`. Test your functions and classes. |
| 59  | Practice test-driven development (TDD). Write tests before code. |
| 60  | Mini project: Build a file organizer script sorting files by extension. |
